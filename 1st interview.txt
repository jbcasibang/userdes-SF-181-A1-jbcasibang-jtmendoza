N/A

3)In your opinion do you think the E-jeep is a good step forward in the transportation problem here in 
the philippine.

3. the idea of E-jeepney is cool because it makes us passenger comfortable because the sits are so soft 
and it has air-condition so that we don't feel so hot like the weather outside, it is a good innovation 
specially in today's generation where in we choose to ride public transportation rather than bringing 
our own vehicle because of the traffic we are currently experiencing so I agree to this kind of concept 
not only to save the environment because it is powered by electricity, it also helps the passenger to 
feel comfortable while travelling.
